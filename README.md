# Pokemon store from 2001

My Pokemon store is available [here](https://even-pokemon-2001.netlify.app/). It uses Vue.js 3, Vuex and Vite. Generation I and II data are fetched from the PokeAPI. It features pagination and the user can select how many pokemons are displayed on each page. Changes to data values are performed through mutations.
